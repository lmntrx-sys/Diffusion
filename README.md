ðŸ˜ŠDiffusion Model
This repository contains the implementation of our diffusion model. The model demonstrates advanced diffusion techniques for
image editing. For detailed information, please refer to our paper linked below.

Overview
Model: This model takes in one image and a different image e.g A dog and a dog wearing glasses with some text description of the change.
        The model learns through diffusion to relate the change with a natural language prompt 
        
Training: Training is to be updated in code but use the link of the paper to look at the mathematical notation
Requirements
Python 3.x
[List of libraries, e.g., numpy, PyTorch]
Installation
Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

bash
    git clone https://github.com/lmntrx-sys/Diffusion.git
    cd Diffusion

Usage
To train the model: Image editing 

bash
    python train.py --config config.yaml
    To generate samples:
